<h1>Django: signup, login and logout</h1>

<i>A little tutorial on how to configure the features of:
signup, login and logout with django and Django Rest Framework</i>


<h3>Install Django</h3>
<p>
<code>pip install django</code>

or specifying the version   
<code>pip install django==3.0</code>

install django rest framework   
<code>pip install djangorestframework</code>   
<i>Remember to add <code>'rest_framework'</code> in INSTALLED_APPS, inside the <b>settings.py</b> file </i>
</p>

<h3>Create Django Project</h3>
Into the project folder:
<p>
<code>django-admin startproject name .</code>

Within the name folder the files will be created:
<ul>
    <li><b>settings.py</b>,  controls the project settings</li>
    <li><b>urls.py</b>, to build in response to a browser or URL request</li>
    <li><b>wsgi.py</b>, Web Server Gateway Interface</li>
    <li><b>manage.py</b>, to execute various Django commands</li>
</ul>

<h3>Create Django App</h3>
<p>
<code>django-admin startapp name .</code>

<i>Remember to add the created app <code>'name'</code> in INSTALLED_APPS, inside the <b>settings.py</b> file </i>

Within the name folder the files will be created:
<ul>
    <li><b>admin.py</b>, configuration for the Admin app integrated in Django</li>
    <li><b>apps.py</b>, configuration for the app</li>
    <li><b>migrations</b>, keeps track of changes made in models.py, so that it is synchronized with the DB</li>
    <li><b>models.py</b>, where models are defined.A model is a class that represents 
    a table in the DB and where each class attribute is a table field</li>
    <li><b>tests.py</b>,app-specific tests</li>
    <li><b>views.py</b>, the request/response logic is managed</li>
</ul>


<h3>Create superusers</h3>
<p>
<code>python manage.py createsuperuser</code>

The most powerful user with permissions to create, read, update and delete data in the Django admin
</p>

<h3>Django Commands</h3>
<ul>
    <li><code>python manage.py makemigrations</code>, when you want make change to a model</li>
    <li><code>python manage.py migrate</code>, when new migrations are available that have not yet been applied to the data in the current instance</li>
    <li><code>python manage.py runserver</code>, to run the local server</li>

</ul>


<h3>Models.py</h3>
<p>
We use the Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system, it fits most of the use cases and is very safe.
We create a new Django Model to store the extra information that relates to the User Model

Name the Django Model as <code>User</code>

User model will be automatically created/updated when we create/update User instances.
Everything is done (like saving) through the User model.

</p>


<h3>Serializers.py</h3>
<p>
It facilitates the conversion of complex data 
to native Python data types that can be rendered using JSON or XML

Create <code>serializers.py</code> file in the app folder and indicate that all fields in the model should be used

<code>create</code> function to save the password.

Raw passwords are not stored, Django provides a flexible password storage system and uses PBKDF2 by default

</p>


<h3>Views.py</h3>
<p>
Create API view

We handle incoming json requests and validate it to confirm that all required fields are correct
In this case, we respond to the request with the POST method.  
Validate the data that will be sent to the JSON  
If everything is correct, we save them in the DB  
And we communicate the outcome of the process through the response.
</p>


<h3>* HTTP Methods </h3>
<p>

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers, works as a <b>request-response protocol</b> between a client and server.

<ul>
    <li><b>GET,</b> used to request data from a specified resource.</li>
    <li><b>POST,</b> when the user has to send data or files to the server.</li>
    <li><b>PUT,</b> used to send data to a server to update a resource.</li>
    <li><b>DELETE,</b> deletes the specified resource</li>
</ul>


<h3>* HTTP Status Codes </h3>
<p>
HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.

<h3>Urls.py</h3>
<p>
A URL is a web address. 

Every page needs its URL, so that the application knows what to show a user visiting a URL. 
Each URL will be associated with a method created in the views.py</p>

<h3>Settings.py</h3>
<p>
Is a core file in Django projects. <br>  
You can configure things like Django applications, databases, templates and middleware, among other things.
